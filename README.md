# Spiking-Neural-Networks-for-Railways-Surface-Defects-Detection

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are an exciting frontier in neural network research, offering a novel approach to processing information that mimics biological neural systems more closely than traditional artificial neural networks. Unlike conventional deep learning models, SNNs process data in discrete spikes, making them potentially more energy-efficient and adaptable for specific applications. This is an exploration of SNNs, comparing them with a classic deep learning backbone, ResNet, to evaluate their performance in feature extraction and anomaly detection tasks.

## Models
### Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Backbone:

Architecture: Includes convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers, with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for spiking behavior.
Training: The SNN was tested without training to evaluate its initial feature extraction and response characteristics.
### ResNet Backbone:

Architecture: Utilizes residual blocks to facilitate deep learning and feature extraction.
Training: ResNet was evaluated in its pre-trained state to compare its feature maps and inference performance.

## Datasets:
Railway images were used for feature extraction and anomaly detection.

## Observations
### Feature Map Comparison:

The SNN shows a broader range of feature values and a lower mean compared to ResNet, indicating different data processing characteristics.
ResNetâ€™s feature maps are more consistent in range and display higher values, reflecting its capacity to capture a broader spectrum of features due to its deeper architecture.
### Spike and Membrane Potential Insights:

The spike counts in the SNN are varied, suggesting a diverse response to different inputs. However, without training, these spikes do not directly translate to meaningful features or anomalies.
Membrane potentials exhibit a wide range, reflecting the initial network state rather than learned features.
### Inference Time:
- SNN: 18.29 seconds
- ResNet: 28.74 seconds

SNN was faster. This efficiency may become more pronounced with optimized implementations and training.
## Future Work
### Training SNNs:

To fully leverage SNNs for feature extraction and anomaly detection, training with labeled data is essential. This would enable the network to learn meaningful patterns and improve anomaly detection capabilities.
### Optimization:

Further optimization of SNN architectures and inference algorithms could enhance performance and make SNNs more competitive with traditional deep learning models.
### Application:

Applying SNNs to real-world anomaly detection tasks, such as railway inspections, could provide practical insights and validate their utility in specific domains.
